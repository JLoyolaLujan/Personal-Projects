# Personal projects

<------------------------------------------>

## Library Website - 1 

Version 1.0 of a fullstack library website. No CSS applied to it yet, jumbly javascript here and there and a huge lack of auth methods that by all means makes this website unusalbe... at the very moment. I'm now taking FrontEnd classes and, as I'm learning, I'm applying my BackEnd knowledge to the best of my ability. 

As I'm advancing with the classes I'll be working on this and will try to, progressively, complete this challenge.

Things to fix: 
    1. Add CSS
    2. Add auth methods
    3. Cypher passwords
    4. Add ROLES

> The more I work on this, the more I'll know what to fix

I had to watch some videos to help myself with the JS, I'm currently in some sort of creative blockage:
